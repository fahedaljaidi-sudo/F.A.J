# railway.json - Railway Configuration

This file configures Railway to deploy from the correct directory.

## Usage

Place this file in the **project root** (c:\Users\gamin\FAJ\).

Railway will automatically:
- Use `backend` as the root directory
- Run `npm install` during build
- Run `npm start` to launch the server
